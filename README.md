This website is the home to my personal and professional portfolio. I started learning about Next.js, Vercel, and Tailwind CSS over 
the summer of 2023 on a mission to build new skills while also showcasing some of my personal projects. I've spent more hours than 
I care to admit learning how to build this site, but the experience has been invaluable. 

This site is deployed on Vercel and can be found at [https://www.russerya.com](https://russerya.com). For site feedback feel free to open a GitHub issue directly in this repo, or send me a message from the website [here](https://www.russerya.com/about-me)
