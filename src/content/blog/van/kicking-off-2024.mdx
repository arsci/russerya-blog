We've got a lot of great van updates to share as we kick off 2024! While last few months have been primarily focused on design and planning, 
at the end of December we installed the first set of major components: A MaxxAir Fan and a Tern Overland Skylight Hatch were installed on the roof, 
swivel seats were installed for both the driver and passenger seats, and we began installing some of the wiring harnesses and insulation. 

Now this post is just a quick update, so in the coming weeks we'll be posting more details for each install. The next items to go in will include a 
Velit Camping 8000BTU air conditioning unit (currently sitting in a box in our garage), more electrical components (batteries, wiring harnesses, solar, etc), 
water tank, and the flooring material! We plan to share much of the design process as well, so keep an eye out for more detailed drawings of what we've been planning!

Here's a few photos as a sneak peak!
