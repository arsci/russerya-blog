Earlier this year I setup Home Assistant as a replacement to SmartThings, but the one missing
component was cloud access. While Home Assistant offers a paid cloud service, we found that it 
was a bit too expensive just to be able to remotely control the lights. 

A few months later I setup a PiHole for ad-blocking/tracking and wanted to be able utilize it
outside of my home network. At the time I happened to also be tired of paying for a VPN service
and constantly having to disable it for specific sites as many now crack down on the major VPN 
providers.

The next step was to setup my own remote VPN server. I'd get the benefit of the added security
on all of my devices when off of my home network, access to Home Assistant on my local network,
and the benefit of the PiHole DNS blocking.

I chose to setup a basic Ubuntu server with AWS Lightsail running Wireguard. This server would
act as my central VPN service that all of my devices, including my Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro 
gateway, would connect to.

### AWS Lightsail

I chose AWS Lightsail primarily for cost purposes. If I had additional AWS resources I needed 
access to over my VPN I likely would have chosen a standard EC2 instance. For this purpose, the 
cost of an EC2 instance was no match to AWS Lightsail. AWS offers the first 3 months for free for
new accounts, and **data is included**.  

On a small instance size you get:

- 2GB Memory
- 2vCPUs
- 60GB SSD Disk

And most importantly:

- **3TB of included data transfer**

The data transfer is what really makes this more cost effective than running a regular EC2 instance!

## VPN Server

### Creating A Lightsail Instance

Once I chose Lightsail, it was time to setup my server. I chose the settings and configurations I wanted
and setup my Terraform code to deploy my instance to a fresh AWS account.
```hcl
resource "aws_lightsail_instance" "wireguard" { 
  name              = "wireguard"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2b"
  blueprint_id      = "ubuntu_22_04"
  bundle_id         = "small_2_0"
  ip_address_type   = "ipv4"
  add_on {
    type = "AutoSnapshot"
    snapshot_time = "09:00"
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

I chose to use port `51821` for my Wireguard configuration, so configured my security group to open that up to all 
IP addresses so our mobile devices could connect outside my home network.

I also added a security group to allow SSH access from my home network and VPN to configure the server. Unfortunately 
Lightsail is fairly limited so fully automating the setup wasn't feasible, but for this situation a manual setup was fine.

```hcl
resource "aws_lightsail_instance_public_ports" "vpn_port" { 
  instance_name = aws_lightsail_instance.wireguard.name

  port_info {
    protocol  = "udp"
    from_port = 51821
    to_port   = 51821
    cidrs     = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  port_info {
    protocol  = "tcp"
    from_port = 22
    to_port   = 22
    cidrs     = ["${var.home_ip}/32", "10.0.0.0/8"]
  }
}
```

Then finally I setup a static IP, and added a Route53 DNS record to point to it. This way I can use my domain name in my client
configurations and if I ever need to move my server to a new account, VPC, etc where I lose the static IP, I won't have
to update every client.

```hcl
resource "aws_lightsail_static_ip" "vpn_ip" {
  name = "vpn-static-ip"
}

resource "aws_lightsail_static_ip_attachment" "test" {
  static_ip_name = aws_lightsail_static_ip.vpn_ip.name
  instance_name  = aws_lightsail_instance.wireguard.name 
}
```

### Installing and Configuring Wireguard

With my instance launched, it was time to configure Wireguard. 

I SSH'd into the instance and installed the necessary packages and settings:
```bash
sudo apt install -y wireguard awscli jq resolvconf mtr traceroute net-tools 
umask 077
```

Enable packet forwarding by uncommenting the following line in `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 
```
and reload `sysctl`
```bash
sudo sysctl -p 
```

Next I generated the keys and created the Wireguard config file. For details on creating the keys, refer to the [official Ubuntu
documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/wireguard-vpn-site2site)

I chose a CIDR block of `10.100.105.0/24` on port `51821` for my VPN network. To start, I only wanted to connect 3 devices to my Lightsail instance
as part of my POC:

* Lightsail Instance: `10.100.105.1`
* Pixel 5: `10.100.105.2`
* Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro (home network): `10.100.105.3`
* Macbook Pro: `10.100.105.4`

### Setting up the configuration file:
#### Interface configuration

* Set the key file when the tunnel is brought up  
  `PostUp = wg set %i private-key /etc/wireguard/%i.key`

* Set the interface IP address for the Lightsail instance  
  `Address = 10.100.105.1/24`

* Set the listener port  
  `ListenPort = 51821`

* Set the DNS endpoint (this is the endpoint for my PiHole on my home network)  
  `DNS = 10.5.5.192`

* And finally we need to set the `iptable` rules to forward traffic correctly between network interfaces  
  `PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE`

#### Peer Configurations
With the Interface configured, we can configure the peers. I generated the keys for each device and setup the Peer configurations in the Lightsail Wireguard
configuration:

* Pixel 5
  ```conf
  [Peer]
  PublicKey = <key>
  AllowedIPs = 10.100.105.2/32 
  ```

* Dream Machine Pro
  ```conf
  [Peer]
  PublicKey = <key>
  AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/11, 10.100.105.3/32 
  ```
  My home network CIDR is `10.0.0.0/11`, which is where the PiHole and Home Assistant are running, so I added those routes.

* Macbook Pro
  ```conf
  [Peer]
  PublicKey = <key>
  AllowedIPs = 10.100.105.4/32 
  ```

The final configuration file looks like this:

```conf
[Interface]
PostUp = wg set %i private-key /etc/wireguard/%i.key 
Address = 10.100.105.1/24
ListenPort = 51821
DNS = 10.5.5.192
PostUp   = iptables -A FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -A FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE 
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -D FORWARD -o %i -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE 
  
# Pixel 5
[Peer]
PublicKey = <key>
AllowedIPs = 10.100.105.2/32 
  
# UDM
[Peer]
PublicKey = <key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.0/11, 10.100.105.3/32 
  
# MacBook
[Peer]
PublicKey = <key>
AllowedIPs = 10.100.105.4/32 
```

## Client Peers

### Android Pixel 5

Wireguard has an Android app on the app store, so it was just a matter of setting the configuration:

#### Interface

- Address: `10.100.105.2/24`  
- Listen Port: `51821`  
- DNS Servers: `10.5.5.192, 8.8.8.8`  

#### Peer (Lightsail Instance)

- Public Key: `<Lightsail public key>`  
- Endpoint: `<dns-endpoint>:51821`  
- Allowed IPs: `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`  

#### On-Demand

For this device I did not want the Always On VPN set, since it only needs to be active when _not_ on my home WiFi network.
Unfortunately the Android Wireguard app does not have an 'On Demand' feature so I needed to use Tasker to automate the
connect and disconnect based on network status.

I created 4 tasker profiles:

* Wifi Connected
  * State: Wifi Connected to [Home SSID] -> Wireguard Off

* Not Wifi Connected
  * State: Not Wifi Connected to [Home SSID] -> Wireguard On

* Airplane Mode
  * State: Airplane Mode Active -> Wireguard Off

* Not Airplane Mode
  * State: Not Airplane Mode Active -> Wireguard On

I also had to set `Allow remote control apps` in the Wireguard settings to allow Tasker to activate/deactivate the VPN.

### Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro

The UDM actually has Wireguard installed already - it's one of the VPN options provided in the UniFi UI. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the
VPN to work through the UI, so I had to manually SSH into the UDM box and create my own interface just as I did on the Lightsail
instance.

```text
[Interface]
PostUp = wg set %i private-key /etc/wireguard/%i.key 
Address = 10.100.105.3/24
ListenPort = 51821
DNS = 10.5.5.192, 8.8.8.8
PostUp = ping -c 1 10.100.105.1
  
[Peer]
PublicKey = <Lightsail public key> 
Endpoint = <dns-endpoint>:51821
AllowedIPs = 10.100.105.0/24
```

### Macbook Pro

Wireguard has an app on the App store that makes this configuration very easy to setup, and it even has an 'On Demand' option to configure
network SSIDs.

#### Interface

* Addresses: `10.100.105.4/24`  
* Listen port: `51821`  
* DNS servers: `10.5.5.192`  

#### Peer (Lightsail instance)

* Endpoint: `<dns-endpoint>:51821`  
* Allowed IPs: `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`  

#### OnDemand:

* On-Demand: Wi-Fi only  
* SSIDs: Except these SSIDs: [Home SSID]
